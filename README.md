#Future Work
• After COVID-19 slumps, the global entertainment industry is set to rebound, 
a new PwC report says.
• Online data consumption spiked 30% during pandemic.
• Gaming and cinema are expected to bounce back.
Video games have steadily risen in popularity for years. And with 
people looking for new ways to socialize and stay entertained 
during the pandemic, the trend has only accelerated. Gaming is 
now a bigger industry than movies and sports combined. 
To begin with, the global OTT market is projected to be worth 
more than $194 billion by 2025. While the future of OTT platforms 
looks bright, service providers should expect to face stiff 
competition. This is because more content creators and 
publishers will try their hands at launching branded OTT apps in 
the coming years. 
According all these, we can see that how peoples are crazy about 
these things. In future work, we make some change which 
friendlier with user or by a web-application or mobile application.
